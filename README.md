  * The Eighth Edition of Zumdahl and DeCoste's best-selling INTRODUCTORY CHEMISTRY: A FOUNDATION combines enhanced problem-solving structure with substantial pedagogy to enable students to become strong independent problem solvers in the introductory course and beyond. Capturing student interest through early coverage of chemical reactions, accessible explanations and visualizations, and an emphasis on everyday applications, the authors explain chemical concepts by starting with the basics, using symbols or diagrams, and conclude by encouraging students to test their own understanding of the solution. This step-by-step approach has already helped hundreds of thousands of students master chemical concepts and develop problem-solving skills. The book is known for its focus on conceptual learning and for the way it motivates students by connecting chemical principles to real-life experiences in chapter-opening discussions and "Chemistry in Focus" boxes.
